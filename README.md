###Introduction
- Bitmail(比特信) is a purly Peer-to-Peer instant messenger client, to help people to communicate with each other securely. 

- Authentication and security are based on PKI(Public Key Infrastructure), and are powered by [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl). 

- A Message singed with your private key is definitely sent from yourself, not from a middle-man.

- A Message encrypted with your friend's certificate, is not viewed by anyone while transferring.

- The rx/tx network is now based on MX(eMail eXchange) protocols, e.g. imap(s) & smtp(s), and is powered by [CURL](https://github.com/bagder/curl). There is more delay than real IM or IRC network. But the MX network can be replaced by (or upgraded to) other transfer networks. 

- Free-speaking is your right. Get the privacy-protection from operators back to yourself.
