###Introduction
- Bitmail(比特信) is a purly Peer-to-Peer instant messenger client, to help people to communicate with each other securely. Authentication and security is based on PKI(Public Key Infrastructure), powered by (openssl, https://github.com/openssl/openssl). 

- To send your friend a message with your signature, will help your friend to known that, this email is definitely sent from yourself, not from any middle-man.

- To send your friend a message encrypted by your friend's certificate, will make sure that, this message is not viewed by anyone while transferring.

- The rx/tx network is now based on MX(eMail eXchange) protocols, e.g. imap(s) & smtp(s), and powered by (libcurl, https://github.com/bagder/curl). There is more delay than real IM or IRC network. But the MX network can be replaced by (or upgraded to) other transfer networks. 

- Talking with your friends, is your right. no one can supervise it.
