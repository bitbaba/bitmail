# Working with examples

In order to run any example firstly you need a browser with support for Web Cryptography API. You can check the status of support [here](http://caniuse.com/#feat=cryptography). Please aware that for the moment (April 2015) Apple Safari does not have a full support for Web Cryptography API, as it shown on the page.

As a major browser we recommend to use [latest Google Chrome development version](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html?extra=devchannel#eula).

After intalling browser you will also need to prepare correct file structure for examples. You need to download [ASN1js](https://github.com/GlobalSign/ASN1.js). Each example need to have "org/pkijs" folder in its root directory with all files from PKIjs and ASN1js combined.
